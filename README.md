# Epidemic Dynamics Analysis with SIRV Model

## Description

This project explores epidemic dynamics using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Vaccinated (SIRV) model. We analyze the impact of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on disease transmission, optimizing model parameters to simulate epidemic scenarios and evaluate intervention strategies.

## Installation

To run the project, ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/epidemic-dynamics-analysis.git
cd epidemic-dynamics-analysis
pip3.11 install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Run the main script to execute the simulation and analyze the results:

```bash
python3.11 main.py
```

Follow the prompts to specify simulation parameters and view the output plots.

## Validation

We validate the model by comparing simulated epidemic dynamics with optimized parameters against separate simulations with different parameter values. While external validation with real-world data is preferred, internal validation techniques provide insights into model behavior and predictive capabilities.

## Results

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating NPIs into the SIRV model for analyzing epidemic trajectories. Our findings provide insights into intervention strategies and highlight the importance of community-level modeling in understanding disease spread.
